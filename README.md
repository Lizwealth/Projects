* ### Amazon Project

1. **[Portfolio](https://github.com/Lizwealth/Projects/blob/main/Lizzy's%20product-management-portfolio-.pdf)**

**Situation:** This is a hypothetical situation that Amazon is starting to create an app/website for purchasing cars. As a product manager, I would need to help Amazon to accomplish this task. 

**Task:** The purpose of this report is the clear process for what a product manager will figure out with the product management team. I think of the customersâ€™ problem in this situation, and also do some interviews for more information to find out some useful features that customers really need. After finding and deciding the features, I chose the MVP features after comparing all those features. These processes are all that will be done as a product management team to launch the Amazon car buying service.

**Action:** I used a lot of methods during this process which include: Product Assumptions Map, Customer Survey, Feature Brainstorm, MSCW Framework, T-Shirt Framework.

**Result:** After all these processes and methods, I could know all the problems I might meet and figure out the best solution with my team. Eventually, I can lead my team to launch the Amazon car buying service successfully.
