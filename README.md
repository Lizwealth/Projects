1. [DfoodHub](https://github.com/Lizwealth/Projects/blob/main/DFOODHUB.zip)

Did this project with a group of Ladies. It aims to address hunger and malnutrition in rural areas of Lagos, particularly in Agege, Mushin, and Oshodi, by the end of April 2023. The project also seeks to reduce food wastage by 75% in areas with food surplus by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, the project aims to enable easy donations of food from people who have a surplus, ensuring transparency in tracking orders. The ultimate goal is to eliminate the problem of malnutrition in at least 20 homes within these areas.
